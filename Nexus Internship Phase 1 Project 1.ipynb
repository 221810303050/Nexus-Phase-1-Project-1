    "## Objective:\n",
    "1. Conversation Context Management:\n",
    "To enable the chatbot to remember previous interactions, ensuring it can provide responses that take into account the ongoing conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation:\n",
    "The conversation_context list stores pairs of user inputs and the bot’s replies. This list serves as the chatbot's memory, allowing it to refer back to earlier exchanges during the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Modular Design:\n",
    "To structure the chatbot’s functionality into separate, reusable functions, making the code more organized and easier to manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation:\n",
    "The chatbot's features are broken down into distinct functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "remember_interaction(): Saves the exchanges between the user and the bot.\n",
    "recall_context(): Retrieves the saved interactions.\n",
    "greet_user() and farewell_message(): Provide standard greetings and goodbyes.\n",
    "ask_user_custom(): Generates and customizes questions for the user.\n",
    "respond_to_basic_questions(): Handles simple, predefined queries.\n",
    "handle_error(): Deals with inputs the bot doesn’t understand.\n",
    "process_user_responses(): Processes and responds to the user’s answers to specific questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Customizable User Interaction:\n",
    "Objective:\n",
    "To create a flexible interaction model where the bot can ask both default and custom questions.\n",
    "Implementation:\n",
    "The ask_user_custom() function begins with a list of default questions and allows for the addition of custom questions. This approach ensures that the bot can handle a variety of interaction scenarios, making it adaptable to different user needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Error Handling:\n",
    "Objective:\n",
    "To manage cases where the bot doesn’t understand the user’s input and to provide a smooth user experience even when errors occur.\n",
    "Implementation:\n",
    "The handle_error() function is designed to provide a generic response when the bot encounters an unfamiliar input. This ensures that the bot doesn't break or give a confusing response when it can't understand the user's request.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Conversation Summary:\n",
    "Objective:\n",
    "To provide users with a summary of the entire conversation, reinforcing the chatbot’s memory feature and enhancing transparency in the interaction.\n",
    "Implementation:\n",
    "After each interaction, the bot prints out a summary of the conversation so far, showing both the user’s questions and the bot’s responses. This helps users keep track of the conversation and provides a clear record of the interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Main Interaction Loop:\n",
    "Objective:\n",
    "To maintain an ongoing conversation with the user, allowing them to interact with the bot until they choose to exit.\n",
    "Implementation:\n",
    "The main() function contains a loop that continues to prompt the user for input and responds until the user types an exit command. This loop ensures that the bot remains active and responsive throughout the session."
